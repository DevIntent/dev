# DevIntent Application Development Schematics

These schematics are still in the experimental phase.

These schematics generate code that leverages the components in the
[@devintent/dev](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devintent/dev) application development library.
The goal is to increase developer productivity, especially when starting a new project.
